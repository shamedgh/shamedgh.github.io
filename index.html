<h1>About Me</h1>
    My name is Seyedhamed (Hamed) Ghavamnia (written as سید حامد قوام نیا in Persian) 
and I am an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science 
and Engineering Department at University of Connecticut.

<br/>
I completed my PhD at the Computer Science Department of 
Stony Brook University under the supervision of my advisor,
<a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/">Prof. Michalis Polychronakis</a>
where I worked on software security and more specifically on attack surface reduction. 
Prior to that I was the team lead for the security software development team in 
Irisa. I obtained my B.E. in Software Engineering from University of Isfahan 
and my M.S. in Computer Engineering with concentration on Network Security 
from Sharif University of Technology. My Master's thesis was about 
traffic analysis.

<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Assistant Professor - University of Connecticut (August 2023 - current)</b></li>

    <li><b>Software Engineer Intern at Bloomberg CTO Office (May 2022 - August 2022)</b></li>
        Performing research on automated policy inference through program analysis.

    <li><b>Research Assistant at Hexlab (May 2018 - May 2023)</b></li>
        I worked on reducing software attack surface by removing
unnecessary code which has been identified by performing static and dynamic analysis.
        Throughout the past years we have worked on identifying properties of specific
        applications which helps debloat or specialize the program to a larger extent than
        previously identified. In
        <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/temporal.sec20.pdf">Temporal Specialization</a>
        we considered how
        the phases of execution of server applications can be used to filter security critical
        system calls (e.g., execve).
        We are also looking into runtime configuration options and trying to extend our
        <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/configdebloat.eurosec19.pdf">previous work</a>
        on configuration-based software debloating to implement a more robust and
        automated framework for doing so. Our work has led to C2C
	(Configuration-to-Code) which will appear at CCS'22.
    <li><b>Software Engineer Intern at Bloomberg CTO Office (May 2021 - August 2021)</b></li>
        Performed research on automated policy inference through program analysis.

    <li><b>Teacher Assistant (Aug. 2017 - May 2018)</b></li>
        Designed and graded two homeworks for the Computer Security Fundamentals
	(CSE 331) course.
        Set up the automated grading framework which used Docker containers for 
	the undergraduate course, Systems Fundamentals (CSE 320).
    <li><b>Team Lead and Software Developer at Irisa (May 2013 - Aug. 2017)</b></li>
        Led team in analsis, design and implementation of an SIEM tool 
with log collection, storage, correlation and incident response. Our tool 
consisted of java and python software development, debugging and research 
in the field of security. Other than software development, I was in charge 
of task planning and assignment using a SCRUM-like method.
    <li><b>Instructor at Feiz College of Isfahan (Jan. 2015 - Dec. 2015)</b></li>
        Engaged in teaching by taking a part time job as an instructor at one 
of the newly opened college institutes in Esfahan. I taught Fundamentals 
of Networking for two semesters there.
    <li><b>Software Developer (Dec. 2011 - Apr. 2013)</b></li>
        Implemented log storage for high collection rate based upon hadoop 
and hbase framework. As part of the task, I designed the complete hardware and 
software architecture and developed required software to fulfill the 
requirements of the project.
