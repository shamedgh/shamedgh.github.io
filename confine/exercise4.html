<h1>Confine Hands-on Exercise 4</h1>
<p>
In this page we will walk through the steps required to generate a Seccomp
profile for a Docker image.
This guide has been prepared for use in the Software Security Summer
School (SSSS'20).
</p>
<p class="thick">NOTE: It is assumed that the <a href="installationguide.html">Installation Guide</a> has been 
followed. Reading
the <a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a> prior to performing these steps is also advised.</p>

<p>After you connect to the provided AWS instance, open a terminal and run the
following commands.
</p>

<div class="tab">

    <h4>System Validation</h4>
          <p>We will  first check that we are running the correct
            kernel version required for completing the hands-on exercise.</p>
          <pre><span class="tryit_run">uname --kernel-release</span></pre>
          <p>This should print the kernel version which should be as follows:</p>
          <pre class="tryit_output">4.15.0-1054-aws</pre>
        <p>It is critical that you see the correct Linux kernel version.
        <br/>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">Please use the raise hand feature of Webex to notify one of
        the panelists if the version does not match.</span>

  <h3>Hands-on Exercise 4 - Using Confine to Harden a Docker Image</h3>
</div>

<div id="Exercise1" class="tabcontent">
  <p>1. Change your current working directory to the root of the respository (<tt>/home/ubuntu/confine</tt>).</p>
    <pre>cd /home/ubuntu/confine</pre>
    <p>2. This time choose one of the following Docker images: Apache Httpd or
MySQL. Try to find the correct image-url by searching for the
image in <a href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a>.
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">MySQL needs extra arguments. If you like
the challenge choose that.</span>
    <p>3. Open a new file, name it as you like. We will use <tt>myimages.json</tt> in the following examples. If you
choose another name you need to change the rest of the commands accordingly.
You can use your favorite text editor (vim, nano, emacs).</p>
    <pre>vim myimages.json</pre>
    <p>4. Use the example from Hands-on Exercise 1 to complete the following JSON
file.</p>
    <pre>
{
    "??": {
        "enable": "true",
        "image-name": "??",
        "image-url": "??",
        "options": "??",
        "dependencies": {}
    }
}</pre>

    <p>5. Now we are ready to run Confine using the following command and generate the Seccomp profile for Nginx.
    <br/>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Note: You must run the following command as root.</span>
    </p>

    <pre>sudo python3.7 confine.py -l libc-callgraphs/glibc.callgraph -m libc-callgraphs/musllibc.callgraph -i myimages.json -o output/ -p default.seccomp.json -r results/ -g go.syscalls/</pre>

    <p>The script will now start analyzing the Nginx Docker image. We will go through
    each step the script is performing and explain the output:
    <br/>
    <span style="font-weight:bold;">a)</span> The script prints the following line, showing it has started its analysis.
    </p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
------------------------------------------------------------------------
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-----&gt;Starting analysis for image: [IMAGENAME]&lt;-----
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</pre>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">b)</span> Then it will start the monitoring phase, which uses 
    Sysdig to identify the binaries executed in the container. This phase lasts for 60 seconds.
    <span style="font-style:italic;">(For more details on why we do this please refer to the 
    <a href="about.html">about</a>  page.)</span><br/>
    In case it is the first time we are hardening a Docker image and we haven't
    previously extracted the list of binaries and libraries it will first print:</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">Cache doesn't exist, must extract binaries and libraries</pre>

    <p>Then it will monitor the executed binaries by running sysdig, generating the following output:</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
---&gt;Starting MONITOR phase:
Running sysdig multiple times. Run count: 1 from total: 3
Ran container sleeping for 60 seconds to generate logs and extract execve
system calls
len(psList) from sysdig: 39
Container: nginx extracted psList with 52 elements
Running sysdig multiple times. Run count: 2 from total: 3
Ran container sleeping for 60 seconds to generate logs and extract execve
system calls
len(psList) from sysdig: 48
Container: nginx extracted psList with 62 elements
Running sysdig multiple times. Run count: 3 from total: 3
Ran container sleeping for 60 seconds to generate logs and extract execve
system calls
len(psList) from sysdig: 45
Container: nginx extracted psList with 63 elements
Container: nginx PS List: {'env', '/usr/sbin/sh', '/usr/bin/basename', 'find',
time...)
Finished copying identified binaries and libraries
&lt;---Finished MONITOR phase</pre>

    <p>In case we have previously ran the dynamic analysis phase and extracted all the binaries and
    libraries, it will only run once. We need this to generate the logs created for
    the Docker image as our baseline to validate the correctness of the generated
    Seccomp profile.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">c)</span> The execution of the script can differ in this step, depending on whether the binaries have been extracted or not.
    In case the dynamic analysis has successfully
    extracted the set of binaries and libraries from the container, it does not
    need to copy the binaries and libraries and it will skip this step.
    Otherwise, it will first generate the list of binaries used in the container
    and then start copying them.</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
Starting to copy identified binaries and libraries (This can take some time...)
Finished copying identified binaries and libraries
&lt;---Finished MONITOR phase</pre>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">d)</span> After the executables have been extracted, 
    the script then starts extracting any direct system calls in them using objdump. It will go
    over all the files copied from the container to the temporary output folder
    and identify direct system calls.
    </p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
---&gt;Starting Direct Syscall Extraction
Extracting direct system call invocations
&lt;---Finished Direct Syscall Extraction</pre>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">e)</span> Then, it extracts the list of functions imported by each binary and library.</p>
    <pre class="tryit_output">
---&gt;Starting ANALYZE phase
Extracting imported functions and storing in libs.out
&lt;---Finished ANALYZE phase</pre>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">f)</span> After it extracts all the direct system calls and combines the imported
    libc functions with the set of system calls required by those libc functions,
    it generates the set of prohibited system calls and prints the following line:</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
---&gt;Starting INTEGRATE phase, extracting the list required system calls
Traversing libc call graph to identify required system calls
Generating final system call filter list
************************************************************************************
Container Name: [IMAGENAME] Num of filtered syscalls (original): n
************************************************************************************
&lt;---Finished INTEGRATE phase</pre>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">h)</span> Now that the unnecessary system calls have been extracted, we generate the
    respective Seccomp profile and validate if it works correctly by
    launching the container with our generated Seccomp profile.</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
---&gt;Validating generated Seccomp profile: results//[IMAGENAME].seccomp.json
************************************************************************************
Finished validation. Container for image: nginx was hardened SUCCESSFULLY!
************************************************************************************</pre>

    <p>If you see the message <span style="font-style:italic;">Container for image: $$$ was hardened successfully!</span>, this means that the Seccomp profile passed our validation steps.<br/>

    <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">IMPORTANT: If you did not see the message above 
    please ask for help from one of the panelists.</span></p>


    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">i)</span> Finally, the analysis of the Nginx Docker image has finished and Confine prints the following line:</p>

    <pre class="tryit_output">
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-----&gt;Finished extracting system calls for [IMAGENAME], sleeping for 5 seconds&lt;-----
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

    <p>6. Now that the analysis is complete, we can view the binaries and libraries that were identified as 
required for the proper execution of the container (stored in
<tt>./output/[IMAGENAME]</tt>):</p>

    <pre>ls -lh ./output/[IMAGENAME]</pre>

    <p>And the generated Seccomp profile (stored in <tt>./results/nginx.seccomp.json</tt>):</p>

    <pre>cat ./results/nginx.seccomp.json</pre>

    <p>0. Change your current working directory to the root of the respository again (<tt>/home/ubuntu/confine</tt>).</p>
    <pre>cd /home/ubuntu/confine</pre>

    <p>1. Which system calls can be filtered? How many are they?</p>
    <pre>
cat results/[IMAGENAME].seccomp.json | grep name
cat results/[IMAGENAME].seccomp.json | grep name | wc -l
</pre>

    <p>2. Determine which kernel CVEs have been mitigated by disabling the above system calls.
    You can use the <tt>filterToCveProfile.py</tt> script to map the generated Seccomp
    profile to the mitigated CVEs.
    </p>

    <pre>python3.7 filterProfileToCve.py -c cve.files/cveToStartNodes.csv.validated -f results/profile.report.details.csv -o results -v cve.files/cveToFile.json.type.csv --manualcvefile cve.files/cve.to.syscall.manual --manualtypefile cve.files/cve.to.vulntype.manual</pre>

    <p>
    <tt>-c</tt>: Path to the file containing a map between each CVE and all the starting
    nodes which can reach the vulnerable point in the kernel call graph
    <br/>
    <tt>-f</tt>: This file is generated after you run Confine for a set of containers.
    It can be found in the results path in the root of the repository.
    <br/>
    
    <tt>-o</tt>: Name of the prefix of the file you would like to store the results in.
    <br/>
    
    <tt>-v</tt>: A CSV file containing the mapping of CVEs to their vulnerability type.
    <br/>
    
    <tt>--manualcvefile</tt>: Some CVEs have been gathered manually which can be specified
    using this option.
    <br/>
    
    <tt>--manualtypefile</tt>: A file containing the mapping of CVEs identified manually to
    their respective vulnerability type.
    <br/>
    
    <tt>-d</tt>: Enable/disable debug mode which prints much more log messages.
    <br/>
    
    <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Note: The scripts required to generate the mapping between the kernel
    functions
    and their CVEs are in a separate repository. You do not need to recreate those
    results.</span>
    
    <br/>
    After you run the script above a single file will be created named
    <tt>results.container.csv</tt>. Each line corresponds to a CVE mitigated in at least one of the Docker images
    provided in the <tt>profile.report.details.csv</tt> file. Keep in mind
that the generated file will have the CVEs for all containers hardened in any
previous run. The last column in the CSV shows the names of the Docker images
which each CVE has been mitigated in.<br/>

    <p>3. View all the mitigated CVEs reported in <tt>results.container.csv</tt>.
    Is CVE-2017-5123 mitigated by applying the Seccomp profile? You can also view the subset of CVEs 
that were not mitigated by the default Docker Seccomp filter, but are now mitigated by Confine.</p>
