<h1>About Confine</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<div class="tabcontent">
<p>
Confine can be used to generate restrictive Seccomp profiles for Docker
images. Due to the nature of OS virtualization technologies, such as Docker,
isolation among different containers is enforced at the software layer in the
Linux kernel.
By prohibiting access to unnecessary system calls, we target reducing the
attack surface of the Linux kernel.
With reliability and soundness in mind, Confine has been built mainly
using static analysis.
To gain a better understanding of how Confine works we provide an overview in
this section. We suggest reading our
<a href="https://shamedgh.github.io/papers/confine.raid20.pdf">paper</a>
for more details.</p>

<h2>Call Graph Extraction</h2>
</div>

<div class="tabcontent">
<p>
We have used an LLVM pass to create a call graph for musl-libc
which maps all the exported functions to system calls. We also used the
gcc RTL and the egypt tool to create a call graph for glibc.
We mainly rely on these two call graphs along with the functions imported from
these two libraries in other applications and libraries to generate the list
of required system calls.

<h2>List of Required Binaries</h2>
</div>

<div class="tabcontent">
<p>
We need to identify which binaries are required for the container to work
properly. It might seem like a Docker iamge such as nginx only executes nginx
and that would be the only necessary binary. But that is not the case, since
most containers run utility programs during their initialization, we need to
identify this set of programs. We have three options for doing so. 
<ul>
    <li>Consider all ELF files in the Docker image.</li>
    <li>Require the user to provide this list.</li>
    <li>Launch the container for a short period of time and extract the
binaries executed.</li>
</ul>

While considering all the binaries is the most complete approach, it comes
with very low security benefit. That is because most containers are launched
with all the binaries and files available in a Linux distribution  (e.g.
Ubuntu). Asking the user would also be complete, but the user might not be
completely aware of all the binaries required for the correct execution of the
container. That is why we choose option 3. We launch the container for 60
seconds (can be changed) and monitor all invocations of the execve system
call. We consider these binaries and all their respective libraries for our
analysis.
